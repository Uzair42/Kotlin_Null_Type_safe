run Function:

    The run function is similar to let, but it executes a block of code within the context of an object. It's useful for initializing objects or performing calculations.




fun calculateSquare(number: Int?): Int? {
        return number?.run {
            this * this
        }
    }

    fun main() {
        println(calculateSquare(5)) // Output: 25
        println(calculateSquare(null)) // Output: null
    }
