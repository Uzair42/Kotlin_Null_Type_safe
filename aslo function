also Function:

    The also function is used when you want to perform additional actions on an object without modifying its value. It returns the original object.


  fun configureAndPrint(text: StringBuilder?){
        text?.also{
            it.append(" after appending ")
        }?.also{
            println(it.toString())
        }
    }

    fun main(){
        configureAndPrint(StringBuilder("Before aslo "))
        configureAndPrint(null)
    }
