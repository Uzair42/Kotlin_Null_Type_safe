Kotlin introduce the null safty feature in kotlin for improving the developer speed , for not searching for error related the null pointer exception in log cat , instead foucus on the development .

                          Nullability and the ? Operator

    Nullable Types:
        Kotlin distinguishes between nullable and non-nullable types. A nullable type can hold a null value.
        You declare a nullable type by appending ? to the type.


        Example: String?, Int?, MyClass?.


fun printLength(text: String?) {
        val length = text?.length // length will be null if text is null
        println("Length: $length")
    }

    fun main() {
        printLength("Hello") // Output: Length: 5
        printLength(null) // Output: Length: null
    }
