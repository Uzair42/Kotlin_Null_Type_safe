2. The Non-null Assertion Operator !!

    Non-null Assertion:
        The non-null assertion operator !! converts a nullable type to a non-nullable type.
        It tells the compiler that you're certain the value is not null.
        If the value is actually null, a NullPointerException is thrown at runtime.
        Use with caution! It defeats Kotlin's null safety.


fun printLengthForce(text: String?) {
        val length = text!!.length // Throws NullPointerException if text is null
        println("Length: $length")
    }

    fun main() {
        printLengthForce("Safe") //Output: Length: 4
        //printLengthForce(null) // Throws NullPointerException
    }
